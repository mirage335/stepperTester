Simple stepper motor tester project. Mount an inexpensive Arduino Nano, 3.3V step down power supply, StepStick stepper motor driver, and rotary encoder, to a breadboard. Easily connect power and stepper motor through a PatchRap Diagnostic board. Replace StepStick drivers quickly and cheaply if an incident occurs. Turn knob to single-step motor, or push to turn continiously.
